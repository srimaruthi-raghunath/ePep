✅ SEO Strategy for epep.in (2025)
🔹 1. Strong Website Naming and Branding

You already have a short, brandable domain: epep.in (great for branding!). Now you need to differentiate clearly from competitors like dailyepaper.in.

🔧 Site Title (for SEO):

Best Online ePaper Hub for All Indian States & Languages | epep.in

🔧 Meta Description (Homepage):

"Access top ePapers from all 28 Indian states in multiple languages — Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi & more. Updated daily. One-stop news portal: epep.in"

🔧 Keywords to Target:

epaper by state

Indian language newspapers online

regional news epapers

statewise epaper collection

Tamil Hindi Marathi Telugu epaper

top epapers India

latest newspaper pdf download India

multilingual epaper portal

🔹 2. SEO-Friendly URLs (Structure & Clarity)

Use clean, keyword-rich URLs for every section.

Example structure:
epep.in/hindi-epapers/
epep.in/gujarat-news-epapers/
epep.in/tamil-nadu-epaper/
epep.in/bengali-newspapers/


➡ Use hyphens (not underscores) and keep URLs short but meaningful.

🔹 3. Content Optimization

Your edge is aggregating state-wise and language-wise e‑papers. So use it for SEO:

For Each Language/State Page:

Include a short intro paragraph (100–150 words) about the state/language, and its newspaper culture.

Add internal links to related states/languages.

Add alt text for epaper logos/images (e.g., alt="Divya Bhaskar Gujarati epaper")

🔹 4. Schema Markup for SEO (Structured Data)

Use JSON-LD
 schema for each newspaper listing:

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "NewsMediaOrganization",
  "name": "Divya Bhaskar",
  "url": "https://www.divyabhaskar.co.in/",
  "inLanguage": "gu-IN",
  "areaServed": "Gujarat, India"
}


➡ This helps Google understand your content and show rich results in SERPs.

🔹 5. Fast, Mobile-Optimized Site

Use:

Lazy loading for epaper thumbnails

Static HTML pages or a fast CMS

Image compression

A responsive grid layout for mobile friendliness

Check scores with Google PageSpeed Insights

🔹 6. Unique Blog Content (Content Marketing for SEO)

Start a blog at: epep.in/blog/

Write about:

"Top 10 Hindi Newspapers in 2025"

"How to Read Any Indian Newspaper for Free Online"

"Regional vs National Newspapers: A Reader's Guide"

"ePaper Reading Habits in Rural India"

"Top E-Papers by Language"

Use long-tail keywords like:

🔹 7. Avoid These SEO Mistakes

❌ Don't copy meta titles from competitors

Educational portals

Quora answers with backlinks to state-specific epaper pages

Reddit threads on news consumption habits

Use anchor text like:
